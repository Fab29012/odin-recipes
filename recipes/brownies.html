    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I’ve had this <strong>brownie recipe</strong> on repeat since the first time I tried it. It calls for basic pantry ingredients, and it’s hardly more difficult than using a mix. As for the brownies, they’re true perfection – <em>glossy, fudgy, and filled with rich chocolate flavor.</em> Trust me, you’re going to want to make them ASAP!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs + water</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>
        <li>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
        <li>Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
        <li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
